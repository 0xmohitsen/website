# Blog

A static SEO-optimized blog is set up to allow content creators to share stories with the world. A static blog differs from a dynamic blog in that the content is stored in files as opposed to in a database. The [sitemap.xml](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/blob/main/src/Controller/SitemapController.php) file is generated on request based on the routes defined in the [config/routing/blog.yaml](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/blob/main/config/routing/blog.yaml) file.

As you can see in the blog.yaml file, all routes are prefixed with the word `blog`.
