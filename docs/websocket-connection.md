# WebSocket Connection

The ChesslaBlab website is integrated with [PHP Chess Server](https://chesslablab.github.io/chess-server/), an asynchronous WebSocket server that provides functionality to play chess online over a WebSocket connection.

The environment variables required for the chess server can be found in the [assets/env.example.js](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/blob/main/assets/env.example.js) file.

As described in [the docs](https://chesslablab.github.io/chess-server/start/), these are the game modes available:

- `analysis` is used to start games for further analysis.
- `play` allows to play chess online with other players.
- `stockfish` allows to play chess against the computer.

The WebSocket ESM modules are implemented based on this same separation of concerns and abstraction:

- [assets/js/AnalysisWebSocket.js](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/blob/main/assets/js/AnalysisWebSocket.js)
- [assets/js/PlayWebSocket.js](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/blob/main/assets/js/PlayWebSocket.js)
- [assets/js/StockfishWebSocket.js](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/blob/main/assets/js/StockfishWebSocket.js)

Let's say you wanted to study a particular chess opening, then a chess game in `analysis` mode is to be started.

**Figure 1**. Click on **Openings > ECO Code** and select "D77 Neo-GrÃ¼nfeld Defense: Classical Variation, Modern Defense"

Data:

```text
/start classical analysis "{\"movetext\":\"1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 O-O 5.O-O d5 6.c4 dxc4\"}"
```

```text
{
  "variant": "classical",
  "mode": "analysis",
  "turn": "w",
  "movetext": "1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 O-O 5.O-O d5 6.c4 dxc4",
  "fen": [

    "rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - d6",
    "rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - c3",
    "rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -"
  ]
}
```

The JavaScript code for this example can be found in the [assets/js/pages/openings/eco_code/index.js](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/blob/main/assets/js/pages/openings/eco_code/index.js) file.

```js
import { openingsEcoCodeModal } from './OpeningsEcoCodeModal.js';
import { sanWebSocket } from '../../../SanWebSocket.js';

await sanWebSocket.connect();

sessionStorage.clear();

openingsEcoCodeModal.props.modal.show();
```

The JavaScript code in the index.js file basically boils down to initialization. The business logic is implemented by a WebSocket ESM module. When the web browser retrieves the response from the WebSocket server, the ESM components are updated with the new data. In this particular case, the chessboard and the SAN panel are updated on chess opening selection.

Remember, the structure of the [App\Controller\Pages](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/tree/main/src/Controller/Pages) namespace is mirroring the structure of both the [templates/pages](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/tree/main/templates/pages) folder and the [assets/js/pages](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/tree/main/assets/js/pages) folder. There is a `.twig.html` file and a `.js` file associated to each controller action. This naming convention allows developers to reduce memorization because given one file name, the name of the remaining two can be inferred.

- [src/Controller/Pages/Openings/EcoCodeController.php](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/blob/main/src/Controller/Pages/Openings/EcoCodeController.php)
- [templates/pages/openings/eco_code/index.html.twig](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/blob/main/templates/pages/openings/eco_code/index.html.twig)
- [assets/js/pages/openings/eco_code/index.js](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/blob/main/assets/js/pages/openings/eco_code/index.js)

Similarly, if you wanted to study a chess position, then a FEN string needs to be started.

![Figure 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chesslablab/website/main/docs/websocket-connection_02.png)

**Figure 2**. Click on **Learn > Analysis Board** and enter a classical chess position in FEN format.

Data:

```text
/start classical analysis "{\"fen\":\"r2q1r1k/1b1nN2p/pp3pp1/8/Q7/PP5P/1BP2RPN/7K w - -\",\"movetext\":\"\"}"
```

```text
{
  "variant": "classical",
  "mode": "analysis",
  "turn": "w",
  "movetext": "",
  "fen": [
    "r2q1r1k/1b1nN2p/pp3pp1/8/Q7/PP5P/1BP2RPN/7K w - -"
  ]
}
```

The JavaScript code for this example can be found in the [assets/js/pages/learn/analysis/index.js](https://github.com/chesslablab/website/blob/main/assets/js/pages/learn/analysis/index.js) file.

```js
import { FEN } from '@chesslablab/chessboard';
import { gameForm } from './GameForm.js';
import { analysisWebSocket } from '../../../AnalysisWebSocket.js';
import * as mode from '../../../../mode.js';

await analysisWebSocket.connect();

sessionStorage.clear();

analysisWebSocket.send(`/start classical ${mode.ANALYSIS}`);
```

The two examples above will give you a sense of the request-response cycle between the web browser and the chess server.
